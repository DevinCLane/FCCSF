# Welcome to the Free Code Camp San Francisco (FCCSF) Web Project.

The goals of this project are:

1. To gather materials and resources related to free code camp San Francisco.

2. To work on an open source project together

3. To have a project where we can collaborate and learn together.

# PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTRIBUTING

## How can I help?

Anyone is welcome to fork this project and create pull requests but please follow these guidelines:

1. Please open an issue with details about what you plan to work on before you begin and assign yourself the task so no one does redundant work.

2. Remember to pull from the source BEFORE you begin working to ensure that you have the most recent code and to avoid merge conflicts.

3. Your pull request doesn't have to be a huge alteration to the code. Any little bit helps!

4. Please be specific about what problem you solved in the commit message. Open issues for next steps. 

5. Feel free to contact us with any questions! This is meant as a safe learning experience. 

6. If these steps aren't followed I will likely not be able to merge your pull request. 

## Next Steps

Looking for contribution ideas? Here's our longterm wish list:

1. A blog section: This will be a place where members can post knowledge articles on what they have learned.

2. A member section for members to introduce themselves and share their github/linkedIn info

3. An about page

4. A contact us page with links to the facebook group, meetup page, and slack group

5. Feel free to make smaller changes as well. See a spelling mistake? Everything helps! If you're unsure how to fix something you are also
