# Welcome to the Free Code Camp San Francisco (FCCSF) Web Project.

The goals of this project are:

1. To gather materials and resources related to free code camp San Francisco.

2. To work on an open source project together

3. To have a project where we can collaborate and learn together.

# How can I help?

Anyone is welcome to fork this project and then create pull requests.
Right now we need:

1. A blog section: This will be a place where members can post knowledge articles on what they have learned.

2. A member section for members to introduce themselves and share their github/linkedIn info

3. An about page

4. A contact us page with links to the facebook group, meetup page, and slack group

5. A live landing page

6. Feel free to make smaller changes as well. See a spelling mistake? Everything helps! If you're unsure how to fix something you are also
